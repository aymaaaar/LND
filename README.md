# ⚽ Football League XML Dataset

## 📝 Project Description
The **Football League XML Dataset** is a simple educational project that demonstrates how to represent structured football club data using **XML** and validate it with a **DTD (Document Type Definition)**.  
This project aims to help students and developers understand how to organize hierarchical data and ensure structural consistency between files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites
Before running or validating the XML file, make sure you have an XML validator installed.

- **Linux / macOS:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libxml2-utils
  ```
- **Windows:**
  You can use the **MSXML** command-line tool or any XML validator (e.g., Notepad++, Oxygen XML Editor, or VS Code extensions).

### ▶️ Validation Instructions
To check that your XML file complies with the DTD structure, use the following command:

```bash
xmllint --noout --valid football_league.xml
```

If everything is correct, no errors will be displayed:
```
football_league.xml validates
```

### 📁 Files Included
- `football_league.xml` — Contains the football clubs data.
- `football_league.dtd` — Defines the structure and validation rules.
